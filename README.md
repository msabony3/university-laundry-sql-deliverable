# 🧺 Laundry Reservation System  

### Overview  
This project was developed as part of a university database and analytics course. It simulates a **laundry machine reservation system** designed for student housing, allowing users to reserve washers and dryers, manage maintenance requests, and track payments.  

The project demonstrates how structured data, normalization, and SQL reporting can create an efficient, data-driven scheduling platform — one that mirrors real-world facility management systems.

### 🧱 Database Design  
The database was built and optimized around six core entities:  
- **STUDENT** – stores student information and login credentials  
- **MACHINE** – tracks each washer and dryer  
- **RESERVATION** – links students to scheduled machine times  
- **BUILDING** – organizes machines by location  
- **MACHINE_TYPE** – defines machine specifications (washer or dryer) and related attributes  
- **MAINTENANCE_REQUEST** – manages issues and repairs  

The schema emphasizes referential integrity, normalization, and real-world constraints to ensure reliable operation and data accuracy.

### 🧮 SQL & Reporting  
Queries were developed to generate insights for both users and administrators, including:  
- Active and historical reservation reports  
- Machine usage summaries by building and time  
- Maintenance issue tracking and status updates  
- Revenue and payment summaries  
- Student usage analytics  

Each query highlights a different SQL concept — from joins and aggregations to subqueries and views — showcasing full-stack data logic in action.

### 🧰 Tools & Skills  
- **SQL (MySQL)**  
- **Excel** for prototype analysis  
- **Data Modeling & Normalization**  
- **Entity-Relationship Design**

### 📚 Learning Outcomes  
This project strengthened my understanding of relational database design, efficient query writing, and how to translate operational needs into structured, analyzable data. It also emphasized clarity in schema documentation and the importance of designing systems that scale with real user behavior.
